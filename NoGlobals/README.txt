The NoGlobals branch moves currently global variables into classes (TModule, TScanner...), in preparation of concurrent unit processing.

The current release candidate is rev. 15852, or the revision that added this file. Some target units may deserve minor updates, that can be made when the branch is merged into trunk.

Development may continue in newer revisions of this branch!
