This tree contains my (JB) some version of my working copy the fpc trunk.
I'll try to keep it in sync with trunk from time to time. Also, I'll try
to keep a working compiler in /compiler, and upload more experimental 
changes that I know to break up the compiler into some path like 
"jan_compiler", or so (that compiler will then probably only produce
non-runnable buggy asm output for demonstration  purposes, only).
